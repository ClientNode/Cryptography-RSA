# Cryptography-RSA
Simple RSA Encryption in Java  

## TODO
- [ ] Fix generation for the value e, it is generated randomly at the moment which is not correct

## Functions
- Genereate random public and private keys
- Encrypt and Decrypt strings
- Load and Save config files
  - Automatically copy encrypted strings after encryption

## Usage
A percompiled binary is included within `"/out/artifacts/Cryptography_RSA_jar/"`
  
## Errors
Have a compilation error for Color?
- Refractor the code and change instances of `Color` to something else (Ex. `ConsoleColor`)  
- If your error is not listed here submit a ticket, I'd be happy to help
